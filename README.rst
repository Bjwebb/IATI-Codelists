IATI-Codelists
==============

These codelists are part of IATI Standard Single Source of Truth (SSOT). For more detailed information about the SSOT, please see https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Standard-SSOT/blob/master/meta-docs/index.rst 

This repository is currently under development, and does not necessarily represent any current or future version of the IATI standard.

Extra Metadata
==============

`complete` - boolean that describes whether the codelist is 'complete' ie. having a value not on the codelist is definitely invalid. An example of an incomplete codelist is country codes, where extra codes may exist for disputed countries.
